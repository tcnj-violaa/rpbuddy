This is a test message that will be split into multiple separate strings that will be typed out by rpbuddy. If the message is longer than the $MAX_MSG_SIZE, rpbuddy splits it however many times needed and types each sequentially to work around the limits. I use this to write paragraph-length RP responses without having to worry about manually splitting -- many times I'm forced to first post what I currently have in order to keep writing the rest, which prevents me from freely revising all of the post before sending it.
If there's a newline (like this!), rpbuddy breaks 'early' regardless of reaching the $MAX_MSG_SIZE. I use these for pseudo-paragraphs when I'm writing.
