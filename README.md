# rpbuddy
Split long messages across multiple shorter messages and automatically type them out into another app with xdotool.  Useful for long messages in MMOs (and likely other things)!

## Description
I wrote rpbuddy to help me with a minor problem I come across -- when I'm roleplaying, I often want to write multi-sentence responses that are often much longer than Guild Wars 2's message character limit, requiring me manually split these into shorter messages and apply proper formatting for each. These character limits force me to post whatever I have written so far in order to continue, which makes later revision impossible. rpbuddy will let me freely compose and edit the entire message and, when I'm ready, send it off to be automatically typed into the game's chat, courtesy of xdotool.

##  Requirements
Programmed and tested using xdotool version 3.20211022.1, but should work with other versions.
